Introduction
============

Servee is a subclass of django.contrib.admin built for front-end editing.
It keeps a separate registry from django.contrib.admin, and the tools are specifically
built with non-technical users in mind.  Many aspects of servee are intentionally basic
to keep dependencies down so it can be used across a very wide variety of projects.

It's also meant to be tightly coupled with wysiwyg components for content
editing. Right now TinyMCE is supported in Open Source, and we have a Redactor build
as well.
