Installation
============


First you should put servee in your environment::

    pip install django-servee
    pip install django-uni-form

or download and::

    ./setup.py develop

Then add servee to your installed apps.

At a minimum, you want to install `servee.frontendadmin`.  This is
the admin site.  You probably also want our wysiwyg tools, and the tinymce
backend (only supported wysiwyg editor at the moment) This converts your textareas
to wysiwyg areas, and that's awesome (sometimes)::

    INSTALLED_APPS += [
        "servee.frontendadmin",
        "servee.wysiwyg",
        "uni_form" # Required
    ]

Then syncdb.  Servee assumes that you're using either contrib.staticfiles or django-staticfiles (>=1.1)
Make sure that you collectstatic in production.

It's important to add servee urls, and you probably want to use autodiscover::

    from servee import frontendadmin
    frontendadmin.autodiscover()
    # ...
    url(r"^servee/", include(frontendadmin.site.urls)),

You probably want several other packages as well::

    pip install django-servee-tinymce
    pip install django-servee-uploadify
    pip install django-servee-image
    pip install django-servee-gallery

Add those to INSTALLED_APPS::

    # before servee.wysiwyg, for static files finding
    "servee_tinymce",

    "servee_uploadify",
    "servee_image",
    "servee_gallery",
