WYSIWYG
=======

The goal of the wysiwyg components of servee is to best emulate the final version of the site.
The included engine is built on tinyMCE, which is already in the source tree. There's also a branch
for Redactor.

The wysiwyg tools abstract the function calls of the engine so that it should be fairly simple to
swap out the rendering engine if you prefer something like FCKeditor or WYMeditor.
