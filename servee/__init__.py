__about__ = """
Servee is for WYSIWYG editing of your models on the front end of your site, and for building tools for site managers, that don't quite belong in the admin.

Servee works best built on Pinax.  You can be picky about which components you want, and it is straightforward to build your own components.

Servee is model-independent, and is designed not to get in the way of the site-building process, but to add a level of functionality and a minimal cost on top of an existing Django or Pinax site.
